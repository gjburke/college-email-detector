dear
mr
grigoletto
sorri
for
not
tell
you
sooner
but
i
am
not
come
to
jazz
band
today
i
had
a
sort
of
linger
cough
yesterday
and
by
the
school
safeti
standard
i
dont
think
im
allow
to
go
i
also
probabl
should
stay
home
just
to
be
safe
not
sure
what
the
cough
is
from
so
it
might
just
be
a
one
time
thing
i
will
be
on
the
zoom
though
thank
for
understand
from
griffin
burk
