will
not
be

class
tomorrow
so
here
is
the
explan
i
receiv
from
the
glenbard
north
teacher
that
make
total
sens
if
you
dont
mind
i
am
go
to
put
in
my
sub
note
that
the
two
of
you
could
do
a
quick
explan
on
thi
to
the
class
i
have
creat
slide
in
the
unumberlnumb
slide
deck
and
honestli
it
realli
will
not
come
up
on
the
test
so
should
not
be
a
big
deal
but
i
want
you
all
to
have
the
correct
info
look
at
the
code
below

the
first
thing
we
need
to
look
at
is
the
equal
method
we
need
to
figur
out
if
we
are
use
the
default
equal
from
the
object
class
or
if
we
have
it
overridden
in
the
rectangl
class
look
at
the
rectangl
class
we
do
not
have
it
there
which
mean
we
are
deal
with
the
inherit
equal
method
from
the
object
class
from
the
java
doc
for
the
object
class
at
httpaddr
the
equal
method
for
class
object
implement
the
most
discrimin
possibl
equival
relat
on
object
that
is
for
ani
non
null
refer
valu
x
and
y
thi
method
return
true
if
and
onli
if
x
and
y
refer
to
the
same
object
x
y
ha
the
valu
true
it
also
say
a
lot
more
but
gener
what
it
mean
is
that
aequalsb
will
onli
be
true
if
they
are
the
same
object
mean
a
b
so
let
look
at
a
practic
exampl
you
buy
a
new
hous
and
paint
it
blue
and
build
a
white
fenc
your
neighbor
end
up
do
the
same
hous
you
new
houseblu
white
hous
neighbor
new
houseblu
white
print
you
neighbor
return
fals
becaus
these
variabl
do
not
hold
refer
to
the
same
object
mean
they
do
not
have
the
same
memori
address
just
like
you
and
your
neighbor
do
no
have
the
same
home
address
print
youequalsneighbor
return
fals
becaus
you
neighbor
return
fals
let
look
at
anoth
practic
exampl
you
buy
a
new
hous
and
then
your
inlaw
move
in
hous
you
new
houseblu
white
hous
inlaw
you
print
you
inlaw
return
true
becaus
these
variabl
refer
to
the
same
object
mean
they
have
the
same
memori
address
becaus
you
and
your
inlaw
have
the
same
home
address
print
youequalsinlaw
return
true
becaus
you
inlaw
return
fals
the
default
version
of
the
equal
method
from
object
ha
a
lot
more
go
on
than
that
deal
with
hash
code
and
hash
tabl
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
thi
class
we
will
oftentim
overrid
the
equal
method
to
perform
whatev
comparison
best
serv
our
code
thank
you
guy
for
be
so
on
top
of
all
of
thi
your
eager
to
