## Use

Clone repo to folder, setup virtual environment and install packages in requirements.txt

Go through Google's Gmail API quickstart for python in order to set up necessary credentials.

Run the program by navigating into the modules folder and running app.py, specify how many emails you want for it to scan and the label name for the detected college emails, log into your gmail to give access, and let it do its thing.

The program will scan and process the amount of emails specified, tagging an email if its a college promotional email or not. 

From there, you can do what you want with the emails (double check, delete, respond, etc)
