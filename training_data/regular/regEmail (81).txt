have
been
great
and
realli
benefici
one
thing
i
find
interest
and
that
i
like
about
the
grade
style
of
ap
lang
is
that
a
chunk
of
grade
is
base
on
reflect
and
how
much
you
learn
not
how
much
you
know
i
think
thi
grade
style
is
veri
benefici
becaus
it
actual
measur
peopl
progress
and
effort
rather
than
if
they
know
someth
or
not
i
find
it
realli
interest
and
i
think
it
’
s
a
good
system
of
grade
overal
im
realli
like
thi
class
and
im
grasp
the
concept
well
im
